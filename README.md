# Customers - Take Home Test

This porject is the answer to a test to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.

The test:
We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office(Starbucks, Saint Stephen's Green, Dublin , Ireland) for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.339428, -6.257664.
